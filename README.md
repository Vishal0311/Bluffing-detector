# Bluffing-detector

## Problem Statement
There is a Human Resource company, which is going to hire a new candidate. The candidate has told his previous salary 160K per annum and has 4+ years experience as a regional manager, and the HR have to check whether he is telling the truth or bluff. 


## Guide
By looking at dataset we can see that there is a non-linear relationship between the Position levels and the salaries.
So, we will use Polynomial Regression.

### The main steps involved in Polynomial Regression are given below:
    1) Data Pre-processing
    2) Build a Linear Regression model and fit it to the dataset
    3) Build a Polynomial Regression model and fit it to the dataset
    4) Visualize the result for Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression model.
    5) Predicting the output.
    
   The dataset contains very less information which is not suitable to divide it into a test and training set, else our model will not be able to find the correlations between the salaries and levels.
